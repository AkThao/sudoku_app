![Sample app icon](linux/128.png)

This directory contains the icons that are displayed for the app, from 16x16 all the way to 1024x1024

The difference between the icons on Mac and the other platforms is that on Mac,
they contain a ~5% transparent margin. This is because otherwise they look too
big (eg. in the Dock or in the app switcher).

The Icon.ico was created from the .png files with
[this online tool](http://icoconvert.com/Multi_Image_to_one_icon/).
